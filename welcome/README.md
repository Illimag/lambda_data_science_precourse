## How to succeed in this course

1. Watch all assignment videos and follow along

In the Google Colab doc, not only will this provide valuable notes to refer back to after watching the videos, but the active nature of typing along will help you retain the info better.

2. Complete all assignment exercises

The assignments are similar to the lecture content but differ in ways that will help stretch your brain and force you to think for yourself rather than copying someone else's code.

3. Be involved in the slack channel in both asking questions and helping to answer the questions of your fellow students. 

Solidify understanding of concepts then explain to someone else.

Welcome students to assist on Slack.

Assignments are open-book, open-neighbor, open-internet.

4. Set aside a block of time every day to work on materials.

5. Attend PM office hours.

Lambda School Staff members will be available most evening to answer questions.

Participate, it improves the experience for everyone!
