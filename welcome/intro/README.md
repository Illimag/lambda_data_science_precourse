# Intro to Google Colaboratory

First need a google account.

We will be using Google Colab which is a tool that is used to share code easily and colab with others via this tool.

## Colaboratory

Under the hood what is really fueling this is a python notebook.

The file type is .ipynb

Can download the file out of the google colab.

## Usage

Write very simple code

2+2

This is 

4

yes this is called math

We can press the + Code button.

If we hold shift we can add another code cell.

It is reading python code and evaluating it and presenting code cells.

The number in the left hand side.

In the order the cells are run.

10*2

20

# Adds two plus two

We can do this more lines

## add as many of these as we need.

It's like its not even there apparently.

Inline comments

	# This is a comment yes

We have text editing buttons

Takes a certain type of markup called markdown

Markdown styles

Different headers

# This is also markup yes

## I know how to do this

### I can make comments wow

This is paragraph text, regular text.

We can add a bulleted list, by adding dashes 

We can have multiple layer of bullets

like so 

- test

- test

- test

	- test

- test

 - test

Just under the video, what are the text sections doing?

we are just deleting this text section.

We are trying to just focus on the code. 

What is happening under the hood.

The simpler, by the way whenever we are typing things in a collab like this, we just need to repeat sections.

The more we have our hands on our keyboards.

What I am about to show you.

	print("hello, world")

This will print

	hello, world

in the google collab file

yes we can use python like so

	python

	python3

	python2

What kind of loop?

We can write in the python shell.

I evaulated and then yada yada.

Print hello world

This is what.

This is the python interactive shell.

What this Google Colab is.

It is that easy to write code

Google doc, sharing collabrative capabilites

We can share it like any kind of google doc.

Enjoying the full Lambda Course.

We wont be able to move on the next yada yada 

Learn more absorb more.
